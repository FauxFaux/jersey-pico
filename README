Introduction:
============

This project provides allows the use of PicoContainer-managed instances as Jersey resources.

The Jersey project provides bindings for springframework and google-guice, but I wanted to see what
it required to use PicoContainer (http://www.picocontainer.org/) as an IoC container within Jersey.

Dependencies:
============

* jersey APIs - see https://jersey.dev.java.net
* picocontainer.jar - see http://www.picocontainer.org

Examples:
========

Please take a look at the web.xml in src/test/webapp/WEB-INF for examples of how to configure the PicoServlet.
All the example code is located in the com.sun.jersey.spi.pico.container.servlet.example package in src/test/java.

You can build and run the examples using ant and the provided build.xml file.
